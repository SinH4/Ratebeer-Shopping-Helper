# Ratebeer Shopping Helper

This little script will help you buy beers for you and other <b>Ratebeerians</b>

### Purpose
This script will allow you to search the ratings of you and your friends, and will show you who already rated the wanted beer.
### Usage
1) Download all your ratings (klick on <i>My Account → My Beer Rantings → Compile My Ratings</i>; leave the stadard delimiter "|")
2) Get your friend(s) to send you  their ratings
3) Run <b>prepare_data.py</b> once for each user (prepare_data.py is only tested on a Linuxmachine)
4) Install <i>QPython3</i> or a similar app on your mobile device
5) Copy the <b>compare.py</b> and all needed <b>*.ratings</b> files to the same folder on the mobile device
6) Start <b>compare.py</b> and have fun

If you run the program only on a computer item <b>4)</b> and <b>5)</b> are unnecessary.
